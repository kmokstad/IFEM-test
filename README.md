# IFEM test models

This repository contains a collection of test models for various
IFEM applications, that was developed during the ICADA project (2009-2012).
Some may also have been included as regression tests in the
[IFEM-Elasticity](https://github.com/OPM/IFEM-Elasticity) and
[IFEM-Stokes](https://github.com/sintefmath/IFEM-Stokes) repositories.

Many of the test models here will probably no loger run in the current version,
but are kept here for the history.
